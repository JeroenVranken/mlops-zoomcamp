# Instructions for running

## 0: Activate environment
```bash
pipenv shell
```

## 1: Bring up localstack:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## 2: Create a bucket:
```bash
aws s3 mb s3://nyc-duration --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566
```

Make sure the endpoint url matches with the endpoint specifiec in the `docker-compose.yaml`

## 3: Check if the bucket was created
```bash
aws s3 ls --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566
```

## 4: Run the tests using pytest
```bash
pytest
```

If all tests ran succesfully, the file should now be available on localstack, you can check using the following command:
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://nyc-duration  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 --human-readable
```
